# Introduction

This project includes simulated and 'golden standard' datasets, software and scripts that we used to benchmark  error correction tools in our study  : Comprehensive benchmarking of error correction methods for next generation sequencing via unique molecular identifiers


# Golden standard data 

We have used simulated and experimentally obtained ‘golden standard’ data from human and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) virus. We used datasets threee experimentally obtained datasets (T1, T2, T3) and three simulated datasets (S1, S2, S3) to becnmark error corretions algorithms. 

## T1/S1 : reads derived from human genomic DNA data

We use genome in a bottle data (GIAB, http://jimb.stanford.edu/giab/). The data was derived from 

composed of high-quality variant calls

## T2/S2 : reads derived from human genomic DNA data

## T3/S3 : reads derived from human genomic DNA data
